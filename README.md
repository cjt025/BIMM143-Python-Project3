Scientific Hypothesis: If the nine most abundant human GI bacteria are genetically similar to each other, then the overuse of ampicillin, a commonly used antibiotic, would be a reason for dysbiosis in the gut microbiome.

You will need 10 files to adequately run the code: 

1) The Jupyter notebook
2) The 9 Fasta files containing the top 9 most populous bacteria in the gut microbiome. 

Information on where to find the FASTA files: 
Sequences of these bacteria were obtained from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore). NCBI houses a series of databases relevant to biotechnology and biomedicine and is an important resouse for bioinformatics tools and services. The gene section of NCBI is able to provide information on a gene's genomic map, expression, sequence, protein function, structure, and homology data.
